	-> Voice SFX + armor SFX

* AI improve (clear/better aggro + search + chase longer/more consistent + min los time before aggro)









# BUGS

* Play again when multiplayer (could be the gamemode immediatly sets back to fialed/end session?)
* Alt tab breaks game in build
* Voice channel brakes if someone disconnects?
* Jester ran away randomly at end gate after killing target (there were many others)
* Play again too many players



---------------------------------------------------------------------------





* Fix raycasts...
	-> Use actual camera rotation in case of player  (somehow) (make t on player that mimics camera rot, link this as origin t instead, also use this as direction instead of dir to target)
	-> sometimes raycast is hitting random object still.....

* Setup session (based on difficulty)
	-> Dont lock all chests
	-> Randomise health
	-> This script can manage all game difficulty related stuff

MAYBE

* Oil
* Ai wander in rooms?
* For testing (single player), run in local host mode?
* Spawn in enemy via scene data after players?
* Wander to close point, bad guy should wander around current place more?
* Try handling player leave
* Player name rotate around y only
* Chase music
* Downed state (camera move?)
* Skillcheck difficulties (certain chests or objects can be harder to unlock)








* TODO full game

- Add pausing
- Add settings + save functionality
- Add steamworks functionality
- Achievements
- Character selection screeen (3D lobby)
- Different difficulty gamemodes

[Netcode] renderTime was before m_StartTimeConsumed. This should never happen. renderTime is 49.9632010023001, m_StartTimeConsumed is 49.9666666666667
