- Level and asset not correct?g









- Can try Restarting when game is over





- Once all items are collected have players walk to exit
	-> host checks if all there and finishes game U7




- Game Win State


- Can try handling player leave

- Why is AI so slow/inconsistent in speed
- AI speed up as game progresses (on item pickup)?
- Reviving?
- Level sections (doors blocking off AI and players)





- For testing (single player), run in local host mode?
- Make sure to account for pathing issues (if a player is not reachable pick another?)
- Aggro sound (state feedback)
- Spawn in enemy via scene data after players?

- Water behavior?

- When host starts
	-> sync gamemode (clients need to know gamemode started)









Start before synchronization complete (maybe it just got stuck)
	-> Hash error
[Netcode] renderTime was before m_StartTimeConsumed. This should never happen. renderTime is 49.9632010023001, m_StartTimeConsumed is 49.9666666666667
