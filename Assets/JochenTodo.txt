* Fix line of sight to check angle with player



* Make new monster state t
* Change override targets in aggro system to have prio + max duration?


















* Game progression on items collect
	-> AI speed increases
	-> Aggro player who took it (how long?)

* Item per player sync
* Light turn on/off + aggro?









- Fix lobby
- Player name rotate around y only

- Why is AI so slow/inconsistent in speed
- AI speed up as game progresses (on item pickup)?
- Does AI get stuck if try to wander to pos it cant reach
- Can try handling player leave


- For testing (single player), run in local host mode?
- Make sure to account for pathing issues (if a player is not reachable pick another?)
- Aggro sound (state feedback)
- Spawn in enemy via scene data after players?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------



- Water behavior?
- When host starts
	-> sync gamemode (clients need to know gamemode started)









Start before synchronization complete (maybe it just got stuck)
	-> Hash error
[Netcode] renderTime was before m_StartTimeConsumed. This should never happen. renderTime is 49.9632010023001, m_StartTimeConsumed is 49.9666666666667
