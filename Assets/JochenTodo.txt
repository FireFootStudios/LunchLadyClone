* Voice chat
	-> Only connect players when game start and more than 1 player
	-> Use correct (unique) channel instead of hardcoded 'lobby'
	-> Serialize customization for settings, tweak them as desired
	-> Also log out +  leave group when exiting








* Crouch


- For testing (single player), run in local host mode?
- Make sure to account for pathing issues (if a player is not reachable pick another?)
- Aggro sound (state feedback)
- Spawn in enemy via scene data after players?
- Wander to close point, bad guy should wander around current place more?

- Can try handling player leave





* Fix raycasts...
	-> Use actual camera rotation in case of player  (somehow) (make t on player that mimics camera rot, link this as origin t instead, also use this as direction instead of dir to target)
	-> sometimes raycast is hitting random object still.....





# BUGS
* Player name rotate around y only
* Revive error
* AI stuck at door

[Netcode] renderTime was before m_StartTimeConsumed. This should never happen. renderTime is 49.9632010023001, m_StartTimeConsumed is 49.9666666666667
