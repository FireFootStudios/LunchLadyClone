* Item per player sync

* Light turn on/off + aggro?


* Crouch


- For testing (single player), run in local host mode?
- Make sure to account for pathing issues (if a player is not reachable pick another?)
- Aggro sound (state feedback)
- Spawn in enemy via scene data after players?
- Wander to close point, bad guy should wander around current place more?

- Can try handling player leave


# BUGS
* Player name rotate around y only
* Revive error
* AI stuck at door

Start before synchronization complete (maybe it just got stuck)
	-> Hash error
[Netcode] renderTime was before m_StartTimeConsumed. This should never happen. renderTime is 49.9632010023001, m_StartTimeConsumed is 49.9666666666667
