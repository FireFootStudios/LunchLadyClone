* Fix play again
* Fix AI stuck in aggro once again (multiple targets maybe swapping? Add cooldown?)
 
* Aggro sound jester
* Dont lock all chests (script that will lock x amount of chests?)
-> This script can manage all game difficulty related stuff

* I like about other map that order of keys was not set, made each game feel a bit different, now the goal is always get the next key...
* Alt tab breaks game ?




* Crouch
-> Lower player focusT
-> Jester look at focusT for los (if exist)

* Kick skillcheck

* Skillcheck difficulties (certain chests or objects can be harder to unlock)


* AI improve (clear/better aggro + search + chase longer/more consistent + min los time before aggro)
* Chase music
* Player name rotate around y only












---------------------------------------------------------------------------







* Oil
* Ai wander in rooms?
* Ai doesnt follow in room anymore???
- For testing (single player), run in local host mode?
- Make sure to account for pathing issues (if a player is not reachable pick another?)
- Aggro sound (state feedback)
- Spawn in enemy via scene data after players?
- Wander to close point, bad guy should wander around current place more?

- Can try handling player leave





* Fix raycasts...
	-> Use actual camera rotation in case of player  (somehow) (make t on player that mimics camera rot, link this as origin t instead, also use this as direction instead of dir to target)
	-> sometimes raycast is hitting random object still.....





# BUGS

Start before synchronization complete (maybe it just got stuck)
	-> Hash error
[Netcode] renderTime was before m_StartTimeConsumed. This should never happen. renderTime is 49.9632010023001, m_StartTimeConsumed is 49.9666666666667
