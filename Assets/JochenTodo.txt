- Move to aggro last valid pos is kinda buggy and gets him stuck for a long time
- Move mod dont work on client
- Door issue


- Fix jackbox sync visual + SFX
- Test jackbox modifier networking
- Test interaction boxes vs jester


* Jackbox
- Activate feedback (visual + sound)
- Deactivate after firing (only visual should remain, maybe just spawn mesh object + sound and delete AI)
- Main AI aggro event on activate
- Spawning
	-> Network object!
	-> Every x seconds, spawn a new one from the main AI










* E to pick up item
* Item per player sync

* Light turn on/off + aggro?
* Jackboxes
	-> Get spawned by monster
	-> Wander around map
	-> Aggro monster

* Crouch



- For testing (single player), run in local host mode?
- Make sure to account for pathing issues (if a player is not reachable pick another?)
- Aggro sound (state feedback)
- Spawn in enemy via scene data after players?
- Wander to close point, bad guy should wander around current place more?

- Can try handling player leave


# BUGS
* Fix lobby player count update
* Player name rotate around y only
* Revive error
* AI stuck at door

Start before synchronization complete (maybe it just got stuck)
	-> Hash error
[Netcode] renderTime was before m_StartTimeConsumed. This should never happen. renderTime is 49.9632010023001, m_StartTimeConsumed is 49.9666666666667
