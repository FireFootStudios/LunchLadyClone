- Lock player controls
- Add timeout on server (equal to mag game duration?)
- Handle cancelation due to death/jackbox


- Create skillcheck base (inherit for actual game implementation)
	-> Start/end
	-> Can repeat?
	-> Network
	-> Only 1 person can do this at a time (for now)
	-> Lock player controls while in progress
	-> Cancel player skillcheck game if attacked (jackbox/jester)

- For testing (single player), run in local host mode?
- Make sure to account for pathing issues (if a player is not reachable pick another?)
- Aggro sound (state feedback)
- Spawn in enemy via scene data after players?
- Wander to close point, bad guy should wander around current place more?

- Can try handling player leave





* Fix raycasts...
	-> Use actual camera rotation in case of player  (somehow) (make t on player that mimics camera rot, link this as origin t instead, also use this as direction instead of dir to target)
	-> sometimes raycast is hitting random object still.....





# BUGS

* Player name rotate around y only
* error play agian

[Netcode] renderTime was before m_StartTimeConsumed. This should never happen. renderTime is 49.9632010023001, m_StartTimeConsumed is 49.9666666666667
