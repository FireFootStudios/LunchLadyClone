- Aggro sound (state feedback)



- Objective 
- AI speed up


- Spawn in enemy via scene data after players?
- Sync gamemode (host manages)
- Game end state (lose)
- Ressing

Start before synchronization complete (maybe it just got stuck)
	-> Hash error
[Netcode] renderTime was before m_StartTimeConsumed. This should never happen. renderTime is 49.9632010023001, m_StartTimeConsumed is 49.9666666666667
