* Camera offset coroutien scale with speed instead of when press sprint button
* Kick feedback
	-> Surfact impact SFX/VFX
	-> Voice SFX + armor SFX



* AI improve (clear/better aggro + search + chase longer/more consistent + min los time before aggro)

* Downed state (camera move?)
* Skillcheck difficulties (certain chests or objects can be harder to unlock)
* Chase music
* Player name rotate around y only

* Dont lock all chests (script that will lock x amount of chests?)
-> This script can manage all game difficulty related stuff

* When a server rpc is called by a client to chagne something, do a check if its server owned, in that case we dont need to do a client rpc (movement + health)
* Interactable feedback

# BUGS

* Play again when multiplayer (could be the gamemode immediatly sets back to fialed/end session?)
* Alt tab breaks game in build
* Voice channel brakes if someone disconnects?

* Oil
* Ai wander in rooms?
* Ai doesnt follow in room anymore???
- For testing (single player), run in local host mode?
- Spawn in enemy via scene data after players?
- Wander to close point, bad guy should wander around current place more?

- Can try handling player leave





* Fix raycasts...
	-> Use actual camera rotation in case of player  (somehow) (make t on player that mimics camera rot, link this as origin t instead, also use this as direction instead of dir to target)
	-> sometimes raycast is hitting random object still.....

Start before synchronization complete (maybe it just got stuck)
	-> Hash error
[Netcode] renderTime was before m_StartTimeConsumed. This should never happen. renderTime is 49.9632010023001, m_StartTimeConsumed is 49.9666666666667
