- Test



- Kick effects are delayed but use initial raycast to hit, this means you cant dodge it!


- Revive works???



* Kick should raycast initially, play animation but apply the effects delays
	-> But since we use networking, we can do it instantly and >


* Kick feedback
	-> Animation (blend with angle)
	-> Tweens (hit/miss tween)
	-> Surfact impact SFX/VFX
	-> Voice SFX + armor SFX

* AI improve (clear/better aggro + search + chase longer/more consistent + min los time before aggro)
* Skillcheck difficulties (certain chests or objects can be harder to unlock)

* Chase music
* Player name rotate around y only

* Dont lock all chests (script that will lock x amount of chests?)
-> This script can manage all game difficulty related stuff

* When a server rpc is called by a client to chagne something, do a check if its server owned, in that case we dont need to do a client rpc (movement + health)


# BUGS

* Wander broken??
* Play again when multiplayer (could be the gamemode immediatly sets back to fialed/end session?)
* Alt tab breaks game in build
* Skill check lock casper movement
* Voice channel broke
* After failing a lot skillcheck it ends instantly (something is building up and not reset )




---------------------------------------------------------------------------





* Oil
* Ai wander in rooms?
* Ai doesnt follow in room anymore???
- For testing (single player), run in local host mode?
- Make sure to account for pathing issues (if a player is not reachable pick another?)
- Aggro sound (state feedback)
- Spawn in enemy via scene data after players?
- Wander to close point, bad guy should wander around current place more?

- Can try handling player leave





* Fix raycasts...
	-> Use actual camera rotation in case of player  (somehow) (make t on player that mimics camera rot, link this as origin t instead, also use this as direction instead of dir to target)
	-> sometimes raycast is hitting random object still.....

[Netcode] renderTime was before m_StartTimeConsumed. This should never happen. renderTime is 49.9632010023001, m_StartTimeConsumed is 49.9666666666667
